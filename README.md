# Simple-Counter
This is a simple counter made with Python and GTK
It's VERY simple : 2 buttons (- and +) and a number. That's it.
May 2025 Update : I just figured out that GTK (pyGObject) don't work with Windows, so I have to use another UI library to release it on Windows. (I will propably use Tkinter or Kivy)
