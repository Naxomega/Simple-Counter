# Simple-Counter
This is a simple counter made with Python and GTK\
It's VERY simple : 2 buttons (- and +) and a number. That's it.\
May 2025 README Update : I just figured out that GTK (pyGObject) don't work with Windows, so I have to use another UI library to release it on Windows. (I will propably use Tkinter or Kivy)\
June 2025 README Update : I launched the app with KDE, and it works, but all of the padding is missing, yeah, I must restart from scratch (goodbye GTK)
