# Simple-Counter
This is a simple counter made with Python and GTK\
It's VERY simple : 2 buttons (- and +) and a number. That's it.\
November 2025 Update : I switched to KDE as my main DE (it was GNOME when I originally created this program), I made some little tweaks and I think that I figured out how to make PyGObject work on  Windows (with msys64) so I will try to launch it on Windows once I return to home (and once i will remember to do it...)\
June 2025 README Update : I launched the app with KDE, and it works, but all of the padding is missing, yeah, I must restart from scratch (goodbye GTK)\
May 2025 README Update : I just figured out that GTK (pyGObject) don't work with Windows, so I have to use another UI library to release it on Windows. (I will propably use Tkinter or Kivy)
